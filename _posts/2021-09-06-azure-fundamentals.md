### Redeem Promotion Code
MPORTANT: The use of the pass is subject to the following Terms and Conditions:

·    DO NOT redeem promo code with an email account that is attached to an EA—the pass will not work.

·    Promo codes need to be redeemed within 90 days of being received.

·    Only one concurrent Azure Pass offer can be redeemed by a Live ID/Org ID.

·    Monetary credit can’t be used toward third-party services, premier support, or the Azure Marketplace and cannot be added to existing subscriptions.

·    If you remove the monetary cap by providing a payment instrument, your account will be converted to a pay-as-you-go subscription at the end of the offer duration. However, if the account has expired, you will need to create a support ticket to enable conversion.

To redeem a promo code, visit [microsoftazurepass.com](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/) and follow these [Azure Pass redemption instructions](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/Home/HowTo).
